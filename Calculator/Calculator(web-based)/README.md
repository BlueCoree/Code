Hi, this my first code that combine several language such MySql, Python, React, HTML/CSS in 1 mini-project.
This experience taught me a lot about how cross-language codes work and try to connect with each other.
Not easy but i'm having fun with the process.
I might try to make 1 more mini project about calculator but apps-based, maybe that will be my last project about calculator.
