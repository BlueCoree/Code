🧮 Fullstack Calculator - Mini Project (Web-Based)

This is my first fullstack mini project that combines multiple technologies:

    🐬 MySQL for data storage

    🐍 Python (Flask) as the backend

    ⚛️ React for the frontend UI

    🎨 HTML/CSS for styling

This project gave me hands-on experience integrating different languages and frameworks into a single application. It wasn’t easy, especially when dealing with frontend-backend communication and database interaction — but it was absolutely rewarding and fun.
📚 Through the process, I learned a lot with this experience, like:

    - Setting up REST API endpoints with Flask
    
    - Managing state and user input with React

    - Styling components with CSS and positioning using grid/flexbox

    - Sending and handling API requests between frontend and backend

    - Understanding how each part (frontend, backend, database) communicates in a fullstack system

💡 Next Steps

I might try to build one more version of this calculator — but as a desktop or mobile app using a different tech stack.
That will probably be my last calculator project before exploring other ideas 😄.

If you're reading this, thanks for checking out my project!
Feel free to explore the code or leave feedback 😄
